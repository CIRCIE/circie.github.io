**Abstract**: The modern, smart society needs a reliable and trustworthy access to the internet of services. Strong authentication mechanisms promise to rise the bar of security and they are polarizing the attention of both institutional and industrial stakeholders. In this survey, we take stock of the strong authentication mechanisms used by e-Banking services in terms of regulations and implementations. To this aim, we reviewed the EU regulations and their evolution in the last decade and we analyzed the strong authentication mechanisms implemented by 26 major EU and non-EU banks.

### RmPerm: A Tool for Android Permissions Removal
*2:40 p.m. - 3:10 p.m.*

Simone Aonzo (Ph.D. Student, DIBRIS, Genoa) 

**Abstract**: Android apps are generally over-privileged, i.e., they request more permissions than they actually need to execute properly. Prior to version 6 users can install an app only by accepting all its requested permissions, while newer Android versions allow users to dynamically grant/deny groups of permissions. Since some them impact on users’ privacy, we argue that users should be granted control at the granularity of the single permission. We propose a novel approach, which does not require any change to the underlying OS, allowing users to selectively remove permissions from apps before installing them, and with a finer granularity. We developed RmPerm, an open-source tool, that implements our methodology, and we present the viability of our approach via an empirical assessment on 81K apps, underlining that, in the worst case, up to 86% of the apps can execute without crashing when none of the requested privacy-related permissions are granted.

### Covert Channels & Information Hiding
*3:10 p.m. - 3:40 p.m.*

Luca Caviglione (Researcher, ISSIA-CNR, Genoa)

**Abstract**: Information hiding techniques are increasingly used by malware to hide itsexistence and communication attempts. Investigating how covert channels can empower
malicious software is essential to fully understand the cybersecurity panorama. This talk
introduces the use of information hiding in modern threats by investigating two different
perspectives, specifically: i) how to detect a local covert channel used by colluding
applications to bypass the security framework of mobile devices and ii) possible ideas for
creating network covert channels for communicating with a remote command & control
facility.

### Break
*3:40 p.m. - 3:55 p.m.*

### Practical Phishing
*3:55 p.m. - 4:55 p.m.*

Michele Orrù (freelancer Security Expert)

**Abstract**: Phishing is a quick, reliable and cost-efficient way of hacking humans.
Since human evolution goes way slower than common beliefs, exploiting software through people, rather than just exploiting software, is convenient. This talk will discuss phishing techniques from an offensive
security perspective. There will not be pie charts.

### Concluding Remarks & Closing
*4:55 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.*
