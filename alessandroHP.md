## Short Bio

Alessandro Armando is full professor at the <a href="http://www.unige.it">University of Genova</a>, where he received
his Laurea degree in Electronic Engineering in 1988 and his Ph.D in
Electronic and Computer Engineering in 1994. His appointments include
a postdoctoral research position at the University of Edinburgh
(1994-1995) and one as visiting researcher at INRIA-Lorraine in Nancy
(1998-1999). He has been co-founder and director of the <a
href="http://www.ai-lab.it">Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
(AI-Lab)</a> at <a href="www.unige.it">DIST</a> (2003-2011), of the 
<a href="http://st.fbk.eu">Security and Trust Research Unit</a> at
the <a href="http://cit.fbk.eu">Center for Information
Technologies</a> of <a href="http://www.fbk.eu">Bruno Kessler
Foundation</a> in Trento (2010-2016), and of the Computer Security Laboratory (CSec) at [DIBRIS](http://www.dibris.unige.it).
He has contributed to the <a
href="http://www.ai-lab.it/armando/GoogleSSOVulnerability.html">discovery
of a serious vulnerability on the SAML-based Single Sign-On for Google
Apps</a> and to the discovery and fixing of <a
href="http://www.ai-lab.it/bugAndroid/bugAndroid.html">a vulnerability
that leads to a Denial of Service attack on all Android devices</a>.
He is co-founder of the [Talos](http://www.talos-sec.com), a spin-off
of the University of Genova focused on Cybersecurity.

His current focus is on developing cutting-edge automated reasoning
techniques and on using them to build a new generation of push-button
software verification and debugging tools supporting the development
of complex, large-scale, distributed IT applications.
