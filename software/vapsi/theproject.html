    <h2>About V@PSI</h2>

   VA@PSI is a three-years project funded by the Italian Ministry of
   Education, University and Research (MIUR) under the FIRB (Fondo
   per gli Investimenti della Ricerca di Base) Programme, as
   RBAU01P5SS.<p>

   Our economic, political, and social life today depends vitally on
   communication and IT infrastructures, in particular the
   Internet. The acceptance and continued expansion of these
   infrastructures depends on trust: all participants must have
   confidence in their security, which is integrated into the
   infrastructure either by means of specific security protocols or
   protocol families (cf. protocols like IPSec, IKE, TLS, and SSH). In
   open networks protocols should work even under worstcase
   assumptions, e.g. messages may be eavesdropped or tampered with by
   an "intruder" or careless principals. Severe attacks can be
   conducted even without breaking cryptography, but by exploiting
   weaknesses in the protocols themselves.  These attacks oftem stems
   from subtle misconceptions in the design of the protocols which are
   very difficult for humans to determine, due to the complex ways
   different protocol sessions could be interleaved, and the possible
   interferences of malicious intruders.<p>

   V@PSI aims to develop a platform based on a variety of techniques
   that will allow industry and standardization experts to
   automatically validate or detect errors on a large collection of
   practically relevant, Internet protocols.<p>

   The overall goals of the project are:

   <ol type=a> 

     <li> to develop a rich specification language for formalizing
          protocols, security goals, and threat models for protocols
          of industrial complexity, building upon existing standards
          for protocol specification (e.g. SDL, ASN.1, UML-CD,
          etc.),

     <li> to advance the state-of-the-art model-checking techniques to
          scale up to this complexity,

     <li> to build a platform based on these techniques that will
          allow industry and standardization experts to automatically
          validate or detect errors, and

     <li> to tune the tool composing this platform and demonstrate
          proof-of-concept on a large collection of practically
          relevant, Internet protocols.

   </ol>

   The partners have previously carried out extensive work that lays
   the foundations of the proposed technology. They have developed
   independently a number of different verification and validation
   techniques based on

   <ol type=i> 

     <li> finite-state analysis by reduction to propositional satisfiability checking,

     <li> infinite-state verification based on interactive theorem-proving,

     <li> model checking interactive distributed systems based on process algebras, and

     <li> model-checking of multi-agent finite state machines.

   </ol>

   The techniques developed by the partners exhibit a strong form of
   complementarity. On the one hand, <i>(i)</i> and <i>(iv)</i> cope
   with the infinity of the search space by building and analyzing
   approximations of the problem which are then iteratively
   improved. These techniques are thus most suited for error
   detection: while <i>(i)</i> has proved very effective in finding
   attacks carried out by an active intruder, <i>(iv)</i> can identify
   flaws by showing that protocols do not ensure the expected security
   goals. On the other hand, <i>(iii)</i> aims at establishing the
   equivalence between a model known to enjoy the desired security
   property and the actual model and therefore, together with
   <i>(ii)</i>, is suited for verification.<br>

   <br>
   The effectiveness of the approaches on small and medium size
   protocols has been demonstrated in previous work. However, whether
   the approaches scale up to the new generation of largescale,
   security protocols remains a challenge.  This will leads us to<br>
  
   <ul> 

   <li> investigate methods for specifying large scale protocols,
        security properties and goals as well as models of intruders
        and threats;

   <li> improve and integrate the verification and model-checking
        techniques previously developed by the partners to scale up to
        industrial security protocols.
   </ul>

   This will be done by developing an integrated verification platform
   based on them, by selecting a set of security sensitive Internet
   protocols, and by using the tools to automatically analyze the
   selected protocols.
