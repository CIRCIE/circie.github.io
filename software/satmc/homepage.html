<h1> SATMC: a SAT-based Model-Checker for Security Protocols and Security-sensitive Applications</h1>

<!-- <p>SATMC (SAT-based Model Checker) is a bounded model checker for -->
<!-- security protocols and security-sensitive applications.</p> -->

<p>
Even under the assumption of perfect cryptography, the design of
security protocols is notoriously error-prone.  Many published
protocols have been implemented and deployed in real applications only
to be found flawed years later.  The problem is that often security
protocols hide subtle flaws that are difficult to detect by a human
inspection.
</p>

<ul id="list">
<li><b>Approach:</b> SATMC reduces the problem of checking whether a
protocol is vulnerable to attacks of bounded length to the
satisfiability of a propositional formula which is then solved by a
state-of-the-art SAT solver.  This is done by combining a reduction
technique of protocol insecurity problems to planning problems and
SAT-reduction techniques developed for planning and LTL that allows
for leveraging state-of-the-art SAT solvers.
</li>

<li><b>Features:</b> SATMC provides a number of distinguishing
features, including the ability to
<ul>
<li>check the protocol against complex temporal properties (e.g. fair
exchange);</li>
<li>analyze protocols (e.g. browser-based protocols) that assume
messages are carried over <i>secure channels</i> (e.g. SSL/TLS
channels).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><b>Success Stories:</b> SATMC has been used to detect
<ul>
<li> a <a
href="http://www.ai-lab.it/armando/GoogleSSOVulnerability.html"
target="_blank">serious vulnerability</a> on the <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/apps/sso/saml_reference_implementation.html">SAML-based
Single Sign-On service for Google Apps</a>;</li>
<li> a flaw in a "patched" version of the Asokan, Weidner, Shoup
protocol for optimistic fair exchange [<a
href="publications.html#csf2007">csf2007</a>];</li>
<li> an authentication flaw in the SAML 2.0 Web Browser SSO Profile
[<a href="publications.html#sec2011">sec2011</a>].</li>
</ul>
SATMC has also been used by SAP Research to perform a complete formal
analysis of the SAP NetWeaver SAML Next Generation Single Sign-On.
</li>

<li><b>Usage:</b> SATMC is used in several advanced research
prototypes and industrial tools:
<ul>
<li>SATMC is one of the back-ends of the <a
href="http://www.avispa-project.org" target="_blank">AVISPA Tool</a>
and of the <a href="http://www.avantssar.eu" target="_blank">AVANTSSAR
Platform</a>.</li>
<li>SATMC is used as an automated testcase generator
in <a href="http://secgroup.ext.dsi.unive.it/tookan">Tookan</a>, a
tool for analysing PKCS#11 security tokens;</li>
<li>
SATMC lies at the core of a Security Validator for business processes
developed by SAP Research which is currently being experimented within
<a

Netweaver BPM</a>.</li>
