<h1> SATMC: Download </h1>

<p>
<b>SATMC</b> (SAT-based Model Checker) is an open and flexible
platform for model-checking security protocols via reduction to SAT.
<b>SATMC</b> takes as input a security problem expressed either in the
IF or SATE languages and returns an attack, if any. </p>

<b>SATMC</b> has been currently extended to handle LTL formulae as a
means to express both more complex security properties and constraints
capturing assumptions on principals and communication channels that
are normally not handled by state-of-the-art protocol analysers.

<b>SATMC</b> can be interfaced with state-of-the-art SAT solvers.  Interfaces for <a
href="http://minisat.se">MiniSat</a> and <a
href="http://www.ee.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html">zChaff</a> are currently supported.

<b>SATMC Version 3.0</b> is available both for Linux and the
Windows operating systems.
