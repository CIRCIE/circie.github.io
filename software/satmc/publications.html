<b>Abstract.</b> Browser-based Single Sign-On (SSO) is replacing
conventional solutions based on multiple, domain-specific credentials
by offering an improved user experience: clients log on to their
company system once and are then able to access all services offered
by the company's partners. By focusing on the emerging SAML standard,
in this paper we show that the prototypical browser-based SSO use case
suffers from an authentication flaw that allows a malicious service
provider to hijack a client authentication attempt and force the
latter to access a resource without its consent or intention. This may
have serious consequences, as evidenced by a Cross-Site Scripting
attack that we have identified in the SAML-based SSO for Google Apps:
the attack allowed a malicious web server to impersonate a user on any
Google application. We also describe solutions that can be used to
mitigate and even solve the problem.

<b>Abstract.</b>  Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols enable companies to
establish a federated environment in which clients sign in the system
once and yet are able to access to services offered by different
companies. The OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Web
Browser SSO Profile is the emerging standard in this context. In
previous work a severe security flaw in the SAML-based SSO for Google
Apps was discovered. By leveraging this experience, this chapter will
show that model checking techniques for security protocols can support
the development and analysis of SSO solutions helping the designer not
only to detect serious security flaws early in the development
life-cycle but also to provide assurance on the security of the
solutions identified.

<b>Abstract.</b> Single-Sign-On (SSO) protocols enable companies to
establish a federated environment in which clients sign in the system
once and yet are able to access to services offered by different
companies.  The OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
Web Browser SSO Profile is the emerging standard in this context.  In
this paper we provide formal models of the protocol corresponding to
one of the most applied use case scenario (the SP-Initiated SSO with
Redirect/POST Bindings) and of a variant of the protocol implemented
by Google and currently in use by Google's customers (the SAML-based
SSO for Google Applications).  We have mechanically analysed these
formal models with SATMC, a state-of-the-art model checker for
security protocols.  SATMC has revealed a severe security flaw in the
protocol used by Google that allows a dishonest service provider to
impersonate a user at another service provider.  We have also
reproduced this attack in an actual deployment of the SAML-based SSO
for Google Applications.  This security flaw of the SAML-based SSO for
Google Applications was previously unknown.</p>

<b>Abstract.</b> 
  We present a model checking technique for security protocols based
  on a reduction to propositional logic. 
  At the core of our approach is a procedure that, given a description
  of the protocol in a multi-set rewriting formalism and a positive
  integer <i>k</i>, builds a propositional formula whose models (if any)
  correspond to attacks on the protocol.  Thus, finding attacks on
  protocols boils down to checking a propositional formula for
  satisfiability, problem that is usually solved very efficiently by
  modern SAT solvers.  
  Experimental results indicate that the approach scales up to
  industrial strength security protocols with performance comparable
  with (and in some cases superior to) that of other state-of-the-art
  protocol analysers.

<b>Abstract.</b> 
 Most model checking techniques for security protocols make a number
 of simplifying assumptions on the protocol and/or on its execution
 environment that prevent their applicability in some important
 cases. For instance, most techniques assume that communication
 between honest principals is controlled by a Dolev-Yao intruder,
 i.e. a malicious agent capable to overhear, divert, and fake
 messages. Yet we might be interested in establishing the security of
 a protocol that relies on a less unsecure channel (e.g. a
 confidential channel provided by some other protocol sitting lower in
 the protocol stack). In this paper we propose a general model for
 security protocols based on the set-rewriting formalism that, coupled
 with the use of LTL, allows for the specification of assumptions on
 principals and communication channels as well as complex security
 properties that are normally not handled by state-of-the-art protocol
 analysers. By using our approach we have been able to formalise all
 the assumptions required by the ASW protocol for optimistic fair
 exchange as well as some of its security properties. Besides the
 previously reported attacks on the protocol, we report a new attack
 on a patched version of the protocol.

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Security protocols are communication protocols that aim at providing security
guarantees through the application of cryptographic primitives. Since
these protocols are at the core of security-sensitive applications in a variety
of domains (e.g. health-care, e-commerce, and e-government), their proper
functioning is crucial as a failure may undermine the customer and, more
in general, the public trust in these applications. In spite of their apparent
simplicity, security protocols are notoriously error-prone. It is thus of utmost
importance to have tools and specification languages that support the
activity of finding flaws in protocols.

This thesis presents an high level protocol specification language accessible
to protocol designers and easily translatable into a lower-level formalism
for protocol insecurity problems. This thesis shows that automatic SATbased
model-checking techniques based on a reduction of protocol insecurity
problems to propositional satisfiability problems (SAT) can be used effectively
to find attacks on security protocols. The approach results from the
combination of a reduction of protocol insecurity problems into planning
problems and SAT-encoding techniques developed for planning. A modelchecker,
SATMC, based on these ideas has been developed and experimental
results obtained by running SATMC against industrial-scale security protocols
confirm the effectiveness of the approach.</p>

<b>Abstract.</b>
  In previous work we showed that automatic SAT-based model-checking
  techniques based on a reduction of protocol (in)security problems to
  a sequence of propositional satisfiability problems can be used to
  effectively find attacks on protocols.  In this paper we present an
  optimized intruder model that may lead in many cases to shorter
  attacks which can be detected in our framework by generating smaller
  propositional formulae.  The key idea is to assume that some of the
  abilities of the intruder have instantaneous effect, whereas in the
  previously adopted approach all the abilities of the intruder were
  modeled as state transitions.  This required non trivial extensions
  to the SAT-reduction techniques which are formally described in the
  paper.  Experimental results indicate the advantages of the proposed
  optimization.

<b>Abstract.</b>
  In previous work we showed that automatic SAT-based model-checking    
  techniques based on a reduction of protocol insecurity problems to    
  satisfiability problems in propositional logic (SAT) can be used      
  effectively to find attacks on security protocols.  The approach      
  results from the combination of a reduction of protocol insecurity    
  problems to planning problems and well-known SAT-reduction            
  techniques, called linear encodings, developed for planning.          
  Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the approach but  
  also showed that the time spent to generate the SAT formula largely   
  dominates the time spent by the SAT solver to check its               
  satisfiability.  Moreover, the SAT instances generated by the tool    
  get of unmanageable size on the most complex protocols.  In this      
  paper we explore the application of the Graphplan-based encoding      
  technique to the analysis of security protocols and present           
  experimental data showing that Graphplan-based encodings are          
  considerably (i.e.up to 2 orders of magnitude) smaller than        
  linear encodings.  These results confirm the effectiveness of the     
  SAT-based approach to the analysis of security protocols and pave     
  the way to its application to large protocols arising in practical    
  applications.

  We provide a fully automatic translation from security protocol

  used to find attacks to protocols.  Our approach results from the
  combination of a reduction of protocol insecurity problems to planning problems
  and well-known SAT-reduction techniques developed for planning.  We

  We describe a model-checker for security protocols based on our
  ideas and show that attacks to a set of well-known authentication
