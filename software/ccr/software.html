<H1> The Constraint Contextual Rewriting Project </H1>

<H2> Software: RDL </H2>

<B>RDL</B> is a system for formula simplification developed within the
Constraint Contextual Rewriting Project.  <B>RDL</B> is an acronym for
<B>R</B>ewrite and <B>D</B>ecision procedure <B>L</B>aboratory.  The
system allows for experimenting with the integration of decision
procedures and conditional rewriting.

<H3> RDL Version 1.1: <a name="highlights">Highlights</a> </H3>

<UL>
<LI> <B>RDL</B> simplifies clauses in a quantifier-free first-order
     logic with equality using CCR.  As a consequence, RDL is sound,
     terminating and fully automatic.
 
<LI> <B>RDL</B> is an open system which can be modularly extended with
     new decision procedures provided these offer certain interface 
     functionalities.
 
     <BR>In its current version, RDL offers <EM>`plug-and-play'</EM>
     decision procedures for the theories of Universal Presburger
     Arithmetic over Integers (UPAI), Universal Theory of Equality
     (UTE), and UPAI extended with uninterpreted function symbols.

<LI> <B>RDL</B> implements instances of a <EM>generic extension
    schema</EM> for decision procedures <a
    href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>.  The key 
    ingredient of such a schema is a <EM>lemma speculation
    mechanism</EM> which `reduces' the validity problem of a given
    theory to the validity problem of one of its subtheory for which a
    decision procedure is available. <img src="pictures/new.gif">

<LI> <B>RDL</B> is an open reasoning module which can be integrated in
     larger verification systems, since extensions of quantifier-free
     first-order logic with equality are useful in practically all
     verification efforts.

<LI> <B>RDL</B> features a tight integration of the following three
     modules: a module for <EM>ordered conditional rewriting</EM>, a
     <EM>satisfiability  decision procedure</EM>, and a module for
     <EM>lemma speculation</EM>.  

     <BR>In the following, let <EM>cl</EM> be the clause to be
     simplified and <EM>p</EM> be a literal in <EM>cl</EM> which is
     going to be rewritten.  The <EM>context</EM> <EM>C</EM>
     associated to <EM>p</EM> is the conjunction of the negation of
     the literals occurring in <EM>cl</EM> except <EM>p</EM>.  Let
     <EM>T</EM> be the theory decided by the decision procedure. 

     <UL>
         <LI> <EM>The decision procedure</EM>.  For efficiency reasons,
	      this module is required to be state-based, incremental,
	      and resettable.  The context <EM>C</EM> is stored by a
	      specialized data structure in the state of the decision
	      procedure.  There are three functionalities.  First,
	      <TT>cs-unsat</TT> characterizes 
	      a set of inconsistent (in <EM>T</EM>) contexts whose
	      inconsistency can be checked by means of computationally
	      inexpensive checks.  Second, given a literal <EM>l</EM>
	      and the current context <EM>C</EM>, <TT>cs-simp</TT>
	      computes the new context <EM>C'</EM> resulting from the
	      addition of <EM>l</EM> to <EM>C</EM> in such a way that
	      <EM>C'</EM> is entailed by the conjunction 
	      of <EM>l</EM> and <EM>C</EM> in <EM>T</EM>.  Third,
	      <TT>cs-norm</TT> computes a normal representation
	      <EM>p'</EM> of <EM>p</EM> w.r.t. <EM>T</EM> and the 
	      information stored in <EM>C</EM>.  This functionality
	      must be compatible with rewriting, i.e. it is required
	      that <EM>p'< p</EM> where < denotes a total term ordering
	      on ground literals. (The actual implementation provides
	      a fixed total ordering on ground RDL literals.)

         <LI> <EM>Constraint Contextual Rewriting.</EM>  The rewriter
              provides the functionality <TT>ccr</TT>.  It handles
              conditional rules of the form <EM>h1 /\ ... /\ hn ==>
              (l=r)</EM>, where <EM>l</EM> and <EM>r</EM> are RDL
              terms, and <EM>h1, ..., hn</EM> are RDL literals.
              Assume <EM>r sigma < l sigma</EM> for a ground
              substitution <EM>sigma</EM> (otherwise, if <EM>l
              sigma</EM> is different from <EM>r sigma</EM>, swap
              <EM>l</EM> with <EM>r</EM> in the following).  Given
              <EM>p[l sigma]</EM>, <TT>ccr</TT> returns
              <EM>p[r sigma]</EM> if <EM>h1 sigma, ..., hn sigma</EM>,
              and <EM>p[r sigma]</EM> are smaller (w.r.t. <) than
              <EM>p[l sigma]</EM>, and for <EM>i=1,...,n</EM> either 
              <EM>hi\sigma</EM> is (recursively) rewritten to
              <EM>true</EM> by invoking <TT>ccr</TT> or by checking
              whether <EM>hi sigma</EM> is entailed by <EM>C</EM>
              (this is done by invoking <TT>cs-unsat</TT> so to check
              that the negation of <EM>hi sigma</EM> is inconsistent
              with <EM>C</EM>).  There are two other means of
              rewriting.  Firstly, <EM>p</EM> is rewritten to
              <EM>false</EM> (<EM>true</EM>) if <TT>cs-unsat</TT>
              checks that <EM>p</EM> (the negation of <EM>p</EM>,
              resp.) is inconsistent with <EM>C</EM>.  Secondly,
              <EM>p</EM> is rewritten to <EM>p'</EM> if <EM>p'</EM>
              has been obtained by invoking <TT>cs-norm</TT>.

         <LI> <EM>Lemma speculation</EM>.  Three instances of the
	      lemma speculation mechanism described in <a
              href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>
	      are implemented in RDL.  All the instances share the
	      goal of feeding the decision procedure with new facts
	      about function symbols which are otherwise uninterpreted
	      in <EM>T</EM>.  More precisely, they inspect the context
	      <EM>C</EM> and return a set of ground facts entailed by
	      <EM>C</EM> using <EM>T</EM> as the background theory.
	      Furthermore, these facts must enjoy some properties to
	      ensure termination (see <a
              href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>
	      for details).

	      <BR>The simplest form of lemma speculation is
	      <TT>augment</TT> <a
              href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>, 
	      which consists of selecting and instantiating lemmas
	      from a set of available valid formulae in order to
	      obtain ground facts whose conclusions can be readily
	      used by the decision procedure.  More precisely,
	      <TT>augment</TT> finds instances of the conclusions
	      among the conditional lemmas which can promote further
	      inference steps in the decision procedure.  There are
	      two crucial problems.  Firstly, we must relieve
	      hypotheses of lemmas in order to be able to send their
	      conclusions to the decision procedure.  We solve this
	      problem by rewriting each hypothesis to <EM>true</EM>
	      (if possible).  This is done by invoking <TT>ccr</TT>
	      and it implies that the rewriter and the decision
	      procedure are mutually recursive.  The other problem is
	      the presence of extra variables in the hypotheses
	      (w.r.t. the conclusion) of lemmas.  RDL avoids this
	      problem by requiring that the conclusion contains all
	      the variables occurring in the lemma and that all the
	      variables get instantiated by matching the conclusion of
	      the lemma against the largest (according to <) literal
	      in <EM>C</EM>.  

              <BR>If a suitable set of lemmas is defined,
	      <TT>augment</TT> increases dramatically the
	      effectiveness of the decision procedure.  Unfortunately,
	      devising such a suitable set is a time consuming
	      activity.  This problem can be solved for some important
	      special cases.  In the actual version of RDL,
	      <TT>affinize</TT> <img src="pictures/new.gif">
	      implements the `on-the-fly' generation of lemmas about
	      multiplication over integers.  To understand how
	      <TT>affinize</TT> works, consider the non-linear
	      inequality <EM>X Y =< -1</EM> (where <EM>X</EM> and
	      <EM>Y</EM> range over integers).  By resorting to its
	      geometrical interpretation, it is easy to verify that
	      <EM>X Y =< -1</EM> is equivalent to <EM>(X >= 1 /\ Y =<
	      -1) \/ (X =< -1 /\ Y >= 1)</EM>.  To avoid case
	      splitting, we observe that the semi-planes represented
	      by <EM>X >= 1</EM> and <EM>X =< -1</EM> as those
	      represented by <EM>Y =< -1</EM> and <EM>Y >= 1</EM> are
	      non-intersecting.  This allows to derive the following
	      four lemmas: <EM>X >= 1 ==> Y =< -1</EM>, <EM>X =< -1
	      ==> Y >= 1</EM>, <EM>Y >= 1 ==> X =< -1</EM>, and <EM>Y
	      =< -1 ==> X >= 1</EM>.  This process can be generalized
	      to non-linear inequalities which can be put in the form
	      <EM>X Y =< K</EM> (where <EM>K</EM> is an integer) by
	      factorization.  The generated (conditional) lemmas are
	      used as for <TT>augment</TT>.

	      <BR>On the one hand <TT>affinize</TT> can be seen as a
	      significant improvement over <TT>augment</TT> since it
	      does not require any user intervention.  On the other
	      hand it fails to apply when inequalities cannot be
	      transformed into a form suitable for affinization.  RDL
	      combines augmentation and affinization <img
	      src="pictures/new.gif"> by considering the function
	      symbols occurring in the context <EM>C</EM>, i.e. the
	      top-most function symbol of the largest (according to <)
	      literal in <EM>C</EM> triggers the invocation of either
	      affinization or augmentation.
