        <BR>
        Maple's evaluator, together with a feature that is usually
        known as the assume facility, is a combination of modules with
        specialised reasoning capabilities.  These modules are
        identified, their interfaces are specified, and their
        interplay is reconstructed as Constraint Contextual Rewriting
        (CCR), a powerful form of conditional rewriting that
        incorporates the services provided by a decision procedure.
        Finally we show how Maple's evaluation process can be
        strengthened by borrowing ideas from CCR.

        RDL is a system for formula simplification in a quantifier-free
        first-order logic with equality.  It implements Constraint
        Contextual Rewriting (CCR, for short), a sound and terminating
        schema for the tight integration of rewriting and decision
        procedures.  The current system takes a clause and a set of
        facts as input and returns a simplified version of the input
        clause.  RDL is fully automatic.  We describe the current
        version of the system focusing on the relationships between
        the implementation and an abstract architecture derived from
        CCR.

	<BR>
	The effective integration of decision procedures in formula
	simplification is a fundamental problem in mechanical
	verification.  The main source of difficulty occurs when the
	decision procedure is asked to solve goals containing symbols
	which are interpreted for the prover but uninterpreted for the
	decision procedure.  To cope with the problem, Boyer & Moore
	proposed a technique, called <EM>augmentation</EM>, which
	extends the information available to the decision procedure
	with suitably selected facts.  Constraint Contextual Rewriting
	(CCR, for short) is an extended form of contextual rewriting
	which generalizes the Boyer & Moore integration schema.  In
	this paper we give a detailed account of the control issues
	related to the termination of CCR.  These are particularly
	subtle and complicated since augmentation is mutually
	dependent from rewriting and it must be prevented from
	indefinitely extending the set of facts available to the
	decision procedure.  A proof of termination of CCR is given.

	<BR>
	We are interested in the problem of integrating decision
	procedures with rewriting as in many state-of-the-art
	verification systems.  We define Constraint Contextual
	Rewriting (CCR) as a generalization of Contextual Rewriting,
	whereby the rewriting context is processed by the available
	decision procedures.  We show how CCR accounts for for some of
	the most important integration schemas adopted in
	state-of-the-art verification systems.  The rule-based
	presentation of CCR given in this paper contrasts the practice
	of describing the integration either by examples or in
	informal ways with high-level ideas intermixed with
	implementation details.  Important properties (e.g. soundness)
	of the proposed integration schema can be formally stated and
	proved.  Moreover, the approach is amenable of
	operationalization.  This has allowed us to easily
	fast-prototype and validate the integration schemas described
	in this paper.

	<BR>In this paper, we propose a generic mechanism for
            extending decision procedures by means of a lemma
            speculation mechanism.  This problem is important in order
            to widen the scope of decision procedures incorporated in
            state-of-the-art verification systems. Soundness and
            termination of the extension schema are formally stated
            and proved.  As a case study, we consider extensions of a
            decision procedure for the quantifier-free fragment of
            Presburger Arithmetic to significant fragments of
            non-linear arithmetic.

	<BR>
	The lack of automated support is probably the main obstacle to
	the application of formal method techniques in the industrial
        setting.  The only way to meet the requirements posed by many
        industrial applications is to combine the expressiveness of general
        purpose provers with the efficiency of specialized reasoners.
        Unfortunately this is a difficult task.  The main problem is that
        only a tiny portion of the proof obligations arising in many
        practical applications falls exactly in the domain the specialized
        reasoners are designed to solve.  In this paper we propose a general
        extension mechanism which allows decision procedures to tackle
        problems falling outside the scope they have been originally
        designed for, thereby considerably enhancing their usefulness in
        practical applications.  We provide instances of the proposed
        extension mechanism that enable a decision procedure for the
        quantifier-free fragment of Presburger Arithmetic to tackle
        non-linear problems of significant difficulty.

	Constraint solving has been successfully employed in diverse
	areas such as Operation Research, Planning, Logic Programming,
	and Automated Deduction. This has led to the development of a
	number of specialised approaches as well as to the adoption of
	different integration schemes and methodologies. In this paper
	we introduce an approach to incorporate constraint solving in
	term rewriting and we compare it with the Constraint Logic
	Programming scheme. We compare the two approaches both at the
	theoretical and at the implementational level and discuss
	potentials for cross-fertilisation.

	There is an increasing evidence that a new generation of
	reasoning systems will be obtained via the integration of
	different reasoning paradigms.  In the verification arena,
	several proposals have been advanced on the integration of
	theorem proving with model checking.  At the same time, the
	advantages of integrating symbolic computation with deductive
	capabilities has been recognized and several proposals to this
	end have been put forward.  We propose a methodology for
	turning reasoning specialists integrated in state-of-the-art
	reasoning systems into reusable and implementation independent
	reasoning components to be used in a ``plug-and-play''
	fashion.  To test our ideas we have used the Boyer and Moore's
	linear arithmetic procedure as a case study. We report
	experimental results which confirm the viability of the
	approach.
