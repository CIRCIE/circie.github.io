<H3> Overview  </H3>

<HR>

<P>
For a complete introduction to Constraint Contextual Rewriting the
interested reader is referred to the two following papers: 
<a href="publications.html#ccr-ftp98">[ccr-ftp98]</a> and 
<a href="publications.html#ccr-frocos2000">[ccr-frocos2000]</a>.  For
a description of the practical extension mechanism for decision
procedure the reader is referred to the paper <a
href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>.

  <TH VALIGN="top"> The Problem </TH> 

  <TD> The effective integration of decision procedures in formula
       simplification constitutes one of the key ingredients in many
       state-of-the-art automated reasoning systems such as <a
       href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/index.html">Acl2</a>
       (NQTHM), <a href="http://www.csl.sri.com/pvs.html">PVS</a>,
       Tecton, and <a href="http://www-step.stanford.edu/">STeP</a>.
       In many cases the interplay between the reasoning modules is so
       tight and complicated that providing an accurate description of
       the integration is a challenge.  As a matter of fact, the
       description available in the literature are given by examples
       or in informal ways with design decision often intermixed with
       implementation details.  As a consequence, most of the existing
       integration schemas are difficult to grasp, making it very
       difficult any attempt to modify, extend, reuse, and reason
       about.  The goal of the CCR Project is the integration of
       reasoning specialists in simplifiers.

  <TH VALIGN="top"> Our solution </TH> 
  <TD>This goal can be achieved in two ways.  First, (in many cases) the
      integration of decision procedure in a verification systems is
      performed by means of a tight cooperation between a rewriting
      engine and a decision procedure.  Making this cooperation
      effective is a daunting task and it requires sophisticated
      techniques.  The difficulties lie in both formalizing and
      proving the desired properties (e.g. termination) of the
      designed integration schema.  Second, the decision procedure can
      be extended by means of a <EM>lemma speculation mechanism</EM>
      in such a way that it is capable of tackling problems falling
      outside the scope it has been originally designed for.  Devising
      sound, terminating, complete (at least for certain subclasses of
      formulae), and efficient mechanisms to extend decision procedure
      is a very difficult task.  In the following, we analize the
      proposed solutions in more details.

      <OL>
          <LI>Based on the integration of a linear arithmetic decision
              procedure in the rewriting activty of the Boyer and
              Moore prover, we propose a new form of contextual
              rewriting called Constraint Contextual Rewriting where
              the decision procedure is allowed to access and modify
              the rewriting context.  Under the assumption that
              certain interface functionalities (satisying some
              abstract properties) are provided by the decision
              procedure DP, CCR enjoys the following properties (which
              have been formally stated and proved): it is parametric
              in DP, it is sound, and it is terminating.

             <BR>The formalization of CCR relies on the notion of
                <EM>Contextual Reduction System</EM> (CRS, for short),
                which generalizes the standard notion of abstract
                reduction system.  Informally, a CRS is defined by a
                set of ternary relations toghether with a set of
                inference roles that define the relations by (mutual)
                induction.  The concept of CRS is the starting point
                for formally specifying and reasoning about
                integration schemas between rewriting and decision
                procedures.


          <LI>In order to tackle the second problem, there are two
	      options.  First, we can devise <EM>practical</EM>
	      extension mechanisms to lift a decision procedure for a
	      theory <EM>T</EM> to proof procedures for a theory
	      <EM>T'</EM> containing <EM>T</EM>.  We propose such an
	      extension mechanism in <a
	      href="publications.html#edp-jucs2001">[edp-jucs2001]</a>
	      generalizing the augmentation technique devised by Boyer
	      and Moore.  We have proved the soundness and the
	      termination of the schema.  In this case, we neglect
	      completeness on pragmatical grounds: the goal is to make
	      decision procedures (available in state-of-the-art
	      verification systems) capable of coping with the wide
	      variety of proof obligations arising in real theorem
	      proving efforts.  Second, we can insist on the issue of
	      completeness in order to lift a decision procedure for a
	      theory <EM>T</EM> to a decision procedure for a theory
	      <EM>T'</EM> containing <EM>T</EM>.  Work is undergone to
	      lift a decison procedure for ground equality based on
	      congruence closure to decision procedures for the
	      theories of lists, commutativity, cancellation, arrays,
	      and homomorphism.  In this case, we have an axiom
	      instantiation mechanism which feeds the decision
	      procedure for ground equality all the ground instances
	      of the axioms which allow to decide any formula in the
	      extended theory.  The decision procedure based on
	      congruence closure is modelled as a completion
	      procedure.  The paramodolation calculus (one of the most
	      important rewriting techniques in literature) plays two
	      roles.  First, the paramodolation rule is used as a tool
	      to design the axiom instantiation mechanism for the
	      extended theory.  Second, the refutational completeness
	      of the paramodolation calculus is the key property to
	      prove the (refutational) completeness of the decision
	      procedure for the extended theory.
