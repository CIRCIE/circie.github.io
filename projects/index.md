Co-Directors: Alessandro Armando and Marc Henauer (Reporting and Analysis Centre for Information, Bern, Switzerland). Funded by NATO in the context of the NATO Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme. 

- [“Energia 2020”](http://www.energia2020.unige.it/en/home/) : an innovative project started in 2011 concerning the Smart City & Sustainable Energy topics. It has been conceived, designed and developed by the University of Genoa with the final goal to make Savona Campus a Living Lab of the City of the Future.
It is based on the following main actions:
-- [Smart Polygeneration Microgrid] (http://www.energia2020.unige.it/en/spm/) (SPM): in operation since February 2014,  it is an "intelligent” & sustainable microgrid feeding the electrical and the thermal loads of the Campus
-- [Smart Energy Building] (http://www.energia2020.unige.it/en/la-sustainable-energy-building-seb/) (SEB): (unveiled in December 2017): “intelligent” & Active ZEB interacting in real-time with the SPM Energy Management System
-- [Energy Efficiency Measures](http://www.energia2020.unige.it/en/eem/) (EEM): Reduction of the Campus consumptions and the energy dispersions at the building level 
- [Smart City Demo Campus] (http://www.energia2020.unige.it/en/smart-city-demo-campus/) (SCDC): The Campus as a “test-bed” of state-of-the-art technologies for the City of the Future (the Campus as an independent “Energy Island” with high confort level for its population)

The “Energia 2020” Research Infrastructures are part of the “Living Lab Microgrid”, the National Laboratory jointly developed by  ENEL and UNIGE to test the innovative technologies of the City of the Future.
